File for programming the silakka54 keyboard via the Vial [website](https://vial.rocks/).

In layer 1 I added Tap Dance keys for the leftmost and rightmost columns. In the image above, italics is for the Hold action.

In TD(n) notation they are defined as follows:
- TD(10): CTRL
- TD(11): SHIFT
- TD(12): ALT
- TD(13): WIN/SUPER

Home Row mods are defined as follows:
- TD(1): ALT
- TD(2): CTRL
- TD(3): SHIFT
- TD(4): SHIFT
- TD(5): CTRL
- TD(6): ALT

And the following on Layer 2:
- Print Screen
- F9 is the AutoHotkey keyboard shortcut for toggling mute on a Teams call
- M0 is the Macro trigger for creating a new Outlook meeting notice (Win+2, Ctrl+Shift+A)
