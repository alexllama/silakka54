# Silakka54 keyboard layout
File for programming the silakka54 keyboard via the Vial [website](https://vial.rocks/).

Current layout (v3)

In layer 1 I added Tap Dance keys for the rightmost column. In the image above, italics is for the Hold action.

In TD(n) notation they are defined as follows:
- TD(14): CTRL
- TD(15): SHIFT
- TD(16): ALT
- TD(17): WIN/SUPER

And the following on Layer 1:
- Print Screen
- F9 is the AutoHotkey keyboard shortcut for toggling mute on a Teams call
- M0 is the Macro trigger for creating a new Outlook meeting notice (Win+2, Ctrl+Shift+A). Note it doesn't work consistently so I am not using it now
