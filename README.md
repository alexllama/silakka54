# Silakka54 keyboard layout
File for programming the silakka54 keyboard via the Vial [website](https://vial.rocks/).

Current layout

Note that I added CTRL, SHIFT and ALT to layer two purely for visual reasons so I could remember where they are. The real usage for them is by adding them to Tap Dance buttons in the home row as follows:
TD(1): ALT
TD(2): CTRL
TD(3): SHIFT
TD(4): SHIFT
TD(5): CTRL
TD(6): ALT

Also, the leftmost column has the modifiers as tap dance combos on Layer 1
TD(10): CTRL
TD(11): SHIFT
TD(12): ALT
TD(13): WIN/SUPER

And the following on Layer 2:
Print Screen
F9 is the AutoHotkey keyboard shortcut for toggling mute on a Teams call
M0 is the Macro trigger for creating a new Outlook meeting notice
